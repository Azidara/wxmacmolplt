Until we get a wiki up and running place notes on the wx port here for
future reference.

Useful reference material:
  wxWidgets book - I have a paper copy on order, the pdf id in
     ~brett/wxWidgets-Docs/
  wxWidgets html docs (also in the above directory. If you download a
     source tarball you can create a link in there to the docs in my afs.

Open Questions:
   How to handle multiple docs.
     There is an MDI class that doesn't appear too bad on Mac and Windows,
     the description doesn't sound too useful on Linux though. Sounds like
     it uses a tabbed window where as I want to view multiple subwindows
     at once.
   How to handle Mac app - book says you must create an offscreen frame 
     such that its frame is used when there are no open windows.
     This is sort of working, but the hidden window shows up in the 
     Window list. Maybe there is a better way?
   I think the Quit, New, Open, and About menu items can be handled by the
     application class.

Short term to do items:
   Settle on MolDisplayWin class and define.
   Implement New, Open, Close menu items.

Potentially useful tools:
   DialogBlocks - GUI wxWidgets dialog editor ($65)
   wxDesigner - also a GUI dialog editor
   poEdit - message catalog creator for internationalization
   wxMathPlot - add on library available from http://wxmathplot.sourceforge.net.
     This might be very useful for the energy and frequency windows.
