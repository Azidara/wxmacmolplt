<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>
wxMacMolPlt is available as a source code tar file and as pre-built binaries for Mac OS X, Windows and several varieties of Linux. If a pre-built binary is available for your platform please try it first to avoid any issues with the build process.
<p>
Most of my development work is done on Mac OS X. Thus, that tends to be the best tested. If you do not see a binary for your OS here please submit a request with information on your OS and hardware architecture.
