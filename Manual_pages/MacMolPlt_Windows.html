   <TITLE>MacMolPlt Windows</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<P>The most important windows in MacMolPlt are:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><A HREF="#MD">Main Display</A>
   
   <LI><A HREF="#Coords">Coordinates</A>
   
   <LI><A HREF="#Bonds">Bonds</A>
   
   <LI><A HREF="#EPlot">Energy Plot</A>
   
   <LI><A HREF="#frequencies">Frequencies</A>
   
   <LI><A HREF="#IB">Input Builder</A>
   
   <LI><A HREF="#Surfaces">Surfaces</A>
   
   <LI><A HREF="#Preferences">Preferences</A>
</UL>

<P>Each of these windows can be opened or brought to the front (the
Main Display window can not be closed without closing the file)
through the subwindow menu. Each file that is
opened has its own set of windows.</P>

<H3>
<HR>
Main Display<A NAME="MD"></A>:</H3>

<P>The main display is the master window for each file (or unsaved
set of data). It is where the molecule is displayed along with normal
modes and surfaces. At the bottom of the window on the left MacMolPlt
prints out the energy and/or the current frequency. On the left is a
scroll bar which indicates which frame in a series of frames is being
displayed. In the main part of the window is the molecule display.
</P>

<P>Tips on rotating and translating: To rotate the display click the
mouse on to the molecule and hold the button down. Simply move the
mouse around to rotate the molecule. To zoom the display hold the
shift key down while moving the mouse up or down or use the scroll wheel
if you have one. To translate the molecule hold the command (control) key
 (apple key) down while moving the
mouse or use the right mouse button. Holding both the shift and command keys to translate into/out
of the screen.</P>
<P>You can copy and paste image directly from MacMolPlt into other applications,
however For better printout I suggest use the
<A HREF="MacMolPlt_Files.html#image">image export</A> option with a resolution
of 300 dpi 
and then import the file into the other application. This will
provide good quality when printed out later.</P>
		<p>Note that the following keys have special functions:</p>
		<UL>
   <LI>Right Arrow: Advance to next frame
   
   <LI>Left Arrow: Go to previous frame
   
   <LI>Left '[': Display previous frequency
   
   <LI>right ']': Display next frequency
</UL>

<H3>
<HR>
Coordinates<A NAME="Coords"></A>:<IMG SRC="Coords_Win.gif" WIDTH=539
HEIGHT=212 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=right>
</H3>

<P>The coordinates window displays the current set of coordinates for
the current frame. The coordinates can be displayed as cartesian
coords or as gaussian style internal coordinates (as shown above). To
edit any value simply <B>double click</B> on that value. The Main
Display will be updated as soon as you finish typing and hit return
or tab or click outside the edit field. The controls at the top of
the window do the following (in order from left to right):</P>

<UL>
   <LI>New: creates a new hydrogen atom at the origin which you can
   then edit into any atom type and position you like.
   
   <LI>Delete: deletes the selected atom(s).
   
   <LI>Bond Update: Updates the bond list by reapplying the auto-bond
   operation.
   
   <LI>Stick Coords: (the little hammer) Changes the current rotated
   orientation to the reference orientation (ie the one whose
   coordinates are displayed in the cartesian coordinates view).
   
   <LI>The pull down menu selects the coordinate view mode (either
   cartesian or gaussian style internals)
</UL>

<H3>
<HR>
Bonds<A NAME="Bonds"></A>:<IMG SRC="Bonds_Win.gif" WIDTH=405
HEIGHT=213 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom>
</H3>

<P>The bonds window allows you to add or delete bonds or change the
bond type. The bond type has no signicance to MacMolPlt other than
the color and pattern used to display the bond. The color and pattern
for each bond type can be modified in the
<A HREF="#Preferences">Preferences window</A>.</P>

<H3>
<HR>
Energy Plot<A NAME="EPlot"></A>:</H3>

<P>The energy plot is a simple window to display the energy for each
frame relative to that for all other frames. Look in the preferences
dialog for options to plot the kintic or potential energy and the MP2
and total energy. In addition you can plot functions of a geometrical
parameter such as a bond length or bond angle, or the RMS or Maximum
gradient. You can also change the energy units and define a reference
energy to use as the zero energy. Colors and indicator size can also
be defined. When you export energies you actually export any
information currently displayed in the displayed units. Thus, you can
obtain a list of bond lengths or bond angles by plotting them and
then exporting the data.</P>

<H3>
<HR>
Frequencies<A NAME="Frequencies"></A>:</H3>

<P>The frequency plot is a simple line graph showing the infrared
intensity versus the frequency. If the intensity is not known then
all frequencies are plotted with an intensity of 1.0. Note that you
can also export the list of frequencies and intensities.</P>

<H3>
<HR>
Input Builder<A NAME="IB"></A>:<IMG SRC="IB_Win.gif" WIDTH=600
HEIGHT=412 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom>
</H3>

<P>The Input Builder window allows you to setup many of the options
needed to create a simple GAMESS input file. Many of the GAMESS
groups and options are not yet present, especially for more advanced
options. There is balloon help for most options, so the best way to
get started is to turn on balloon help and then look around at the
different items. All of the options which are visible are
implemented, but there may be options which are unavailable in the
input builder, but still needed to get a correct GAMESS run.</P>

<P>The basic design of the input builder window is that the most
important input options (the required groups) are listed at the top
left of the window. These are groups that you should always check
before creating an input deck. The second list contains groups for
which the defaults are generally adequate (thus they are optional).
These lists are not constant. New groups are added and removed
depending on options you select. For instance, if you select an MP2
wavefunction type then an optional MP2 group will be added to the
optional groups list.</P>

<P>Once you have selected all of the options that you need you can
click the "write file" button, which will prompt for a file name to
write the GAMESS input file. All of the options which you have set
will be written to the file, but options which are unchanged from
their GAMESS defaults are skipped. The coordinates for the current
frame will be punched out into the $DATA group. You should examine
the resulting input file and make sure that all required options are
present.</P>

<H3>
<HR>
Surfaces<A NAME="Surfaces"></A>:<IMG SRC="2D_Orbital_Dialog.gif" WIDTH=449
HEIGHT=385 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=right>
</H3>

<P>The surfaces window allows the create/deletion and modification of
all supported surface types. For information on specific surface
options refer <A HREF="MacMolPlt_Surfaces.html">Surfaces Page</A>.
There are several controls common to all surface types. The common
functions are:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Surface List: Lists all of the defined surfaces for the
   current frame. Click on one of the list items to view the details
   of that surface (like the 2D Orbital above).
   
   <LI>Add: prompts you for the type of surface to add and then
   creates a new surface.
   
   <LI>Delete: Deletes the surface that is currently selected.
   
   <LI>Update: Applies any changes to the current surface and updates
   the data and then the display.
   
   <LI>Surface Title: This is an edit field which is a simple text
   label for the selected surface. This label will appear in the
   Surface list at the bottom of the window.
   
   <LI>Visible: If checked the surface will be visible in the main
   display window. If not the surface will not be displayed. This is
   useful when you want to have a surface defined, but temporarily
   hidden.
   
   <LI>All Frames: When checked the selected surface will be applied
   to all frames that have the correct data available. (ie you can
   animate orbitals when this is checked!) Note that for 3D surfaces
   the grid is calculated for each frame, contoured and then
   imediately disposed. Thus check this box after you are satisfied
   with all of the settings for the surface.
</UL>

<H3>
<HR>
Preferences<A NAME="Preferences"></A>:</H3>

<P>A great many features in MacMolPlt are customizable. Each file has
its own set of preferences which are inherited from the global
default preferences (set using the Default Preferences menu item in
the Edit menu). You can then modify these preferences to suit your
own taste. These include atom colors and patterns, atom sizes, etc
