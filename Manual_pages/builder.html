Its goal is to make it fast and easy to create starting structures without placing significant restraints on your freedom to build the molecule anyway you wish. Note there is unlimited undo/redo support while in the molecule builder. However the undo buffer is flushed when you exit build mode. Below is a brief introduction to the features of the builder.</p>		<p><a href="#Getting_Started">Getting started</a></p>		<p><a href="#Adding_Bonds">Adding Bonds</a></p>		<p><a href="#Modifying_subgroups">Modifying subgroups</a></p>		<p><a href="#misc">Final thoughts</a></p>		<hr>		<h3><a name="Getting_Started"></a>Getting Started</h3>		<p>Activate the molecule editor by choosing the &quot;Enable Molecule Builder&quot; menu item from the &quot;Builder&quot; menu. This will display a button bar at the top of the molecule display.  You can activate the builder for empty windows or with an existing geometry. However, if you modify an existing structure all existing data such as orbitals and normal modes will be lost. The three buttons control the mode of operation. &quot;View&quot; mode is the normal rotation/translation mode used throughout MacMolPlt. You can select atoms, but you can not edit them. &quot;Select&quot; mode allows you to select all atoms in a region of the window by drawing a selection box around them. Finally &quot;Edit&quot; mode allows you to add/delete/modify the molecular structure. While in &quot;Edit&quot; mode a left-click into empty space will add a new atom (of the type currently selected on the periodic table) to that spot. A left-click and drag will rotate as per normal.</p>		<p>To start adding atoms display the periodic table palette (&quot;Show Periodic Table&quot; menu item under the &quot;Builder&quot; menu) and choose an atom type. Then enter &quot;Edit&quot; mode by clicking on the hand icon. Left-click anyway in the display to add an atom. If carbon is selected you should see something like this.<img src="bond_sites.jpg" alt="" height="186" width="159" align="right" border="0"></p>		<p>The red cylinders are open &quot;bonding sites&quot;. To add a new atom to one of the bonding sites (at an appropriate bond distance) just click on that bond site. If you do not care for the bonding site approach you can turn off the bond site display and add atoms freehand. Once an atom is added you can click on it and drag it around as desired. See the modifying subgroups section later for more information on moving groups of atoms around. If you right-click (or control+left-click) on a bond you can change the bond order. If either atom in the bond had no other bonds to it the bond length will be adjusted for the new bond order. </p>		<p>To quickly fill out the remaining bond sites with Hydrogens use the &quot;Add Hydrogens&quot; menu item from the &quot;Builder&quot; menu.</p>		<hr>		<h3><a name="Adding_Bonds"></a>Adding Bonds</h3>		<p>Occasionally you will need to manually add or modify bonds. The are two ways to add a bond. You can select both atoms then right-click (or control+left-click) on one of them and select the &quot;Add Bond&quot; item from the pop-up menu. Or you can click and drag from the bonding site of interest on one atom to a bonding site on the other atom. To modify or delete bonds simply right-click on them. You can change the bond order or delete the bond entirely. Changing the bond order will change the bond site arrangement on the atoms and will change the bond length (if one of the atoms has no other bonds), but it will not rearrange existing bonds.</p>		<hr>		<h3><a name="Modifying_subgroups"></a>Modifying Subgroups</h3>		<p>There are several ways to transform groups of atoms in the builder, but first you need to get the atoms of interest selected. To move an individual atom just left-click on it and drag it around. To select multiple atoms you can either select them individually (holding down the command key to extend the selection) or as a group using the select button (Tip: While in &quot;Edit&quot; mode you can hold down the &quot;Alt&quot; key to temporarilly switch to &quot;Select&quot; mode. Then release the alt key to continue in &quot;Edit&quot; mode). Now if you left-click and drag on any of the selected atoms you will translate them all. If you hold the control key down while dragging you will switch from translation to rotation about the center of the selection set. This makes it possible to spin a solvent molecule for example in place.</p>		<p>To rotate a functional group around a bond select the atoms in the functional group. Then left-click on the bond about which the rotation should occur and drag up and down. The dragging motion will be translated into rotation about the axis of the bond.</p>		<hr>		<h3><a name="misc"></a>Final Thoughts</h3>		<p>Occasionally a mouse click is not handled correctly and an atom is added by mistake. If that happens just undo it.</p>		<p>A natural extension to the builder will be a palette with functional subgroups, solvents, etc. This is a planned addition for the future.</p>	</body></html>
