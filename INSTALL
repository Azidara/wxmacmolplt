Currently wxMacMolPlt includes build files and has been tested on Mac OS X,
Linux and Windows. Since most people building from source will be running
Linux this file focuses on the build instructions for Linux. To build from
source on any OS you must have a C++ compiler such as g++ and an install
of wxWidgets with OpenGL support enabled. wxWidgets 2.6 and later should work.
Prebuilt packages should also work. We have tested against the version 2.6.3
prebuilt package within Debain and foudn it to work.

If your distribution does not offer a prebuilt wxWidgets package you will need
to grab the latest source copy from www.wxwidgets.org and install it. You 
should be able to do this using the following:
   ./configure --with-opengl
   make
   make install

To install MacMolPlt run:
  ./configure
  make
  make install
If you have installed wxWidgets in a non-standard location you can add
--with-wx-config=/path/to/wx
to the ./configure step. The make install step is important as it installs two
required resource files in addition to the binary. Once installed you should
be able to run MacMolPlt by typing "wxMacMolPlt".
