wxMacMolPlt is a wxWidgets rewrite of MacMolPlt by Brett Bode's research group at
Iowa State University. The source code to this program is released under the 
terms of the license file in this directory.

Currently wxMacMolPlt includes build files and has been tested on Mac OS X,
Linux and Windows. Since most people building from source will be running
Linux this file focuses on the build instructions for Linux. To build from
source on any OS you must have a C++ compiler such as g++ and an install
of wxWidgets with OpenGL support enabled. wxWidgets 2.6 and later should work.
Prebuilt packages should also work. We have tested against the version 2.6.3
prebuilt package within Debain and found it to work.

For further build instructions refer the INSTALL file in this directory.

An html manual is included that includes a quick walkthrough of the program's
capabilities.
